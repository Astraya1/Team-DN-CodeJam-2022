# TruckoMap: For 123LoadBoard Code.Jam() 2022
**Please review the [123LoadBoard Challenge for the challenge guidelines](https://codejam.123loadboard.com/).**

## Brief Description
This program allows truckers to find the most profitable trip to take when shipping loads sourced from a marketplace.

This program reads through a CSV file to then determine the most profitable trip a trucker can undertake. 

Truckers will start from a determined starting point and then drive to their destination nodes. Routes that connect each node are all linked to costs due to the driving costs. Some routes have profits linked to it if the route links you to the shipping destination.
